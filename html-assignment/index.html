            <h2> My Little Parahraph </h2>
        <p> To start, I want to apologize for the late submission. Long story short I had covid and I wasn't able to complete it on time. I drank a bunch of H<sub>2</sub>0, which helped a bunch! Super random addition but that subscript had to come in somewhere. On that note, I guess the first thing about me I'll address is that I have a <abbr title=""> very</abbr> weak immune system <em> 'ba dum tss!'</em> Okay enough of the lame jones, let me continue. I did a tad bit of HTML in my tumblr days, not as extreme as this but I digress. I always wanted to further my curiosity with coding so I'm very excited to be apart of your class even if my weak immune system got in the way. I can't wait to learn more from you!</p>

        <p>I'm aware this propbably won't be marked but I wanted to do it anyways. Thanks!</p>
